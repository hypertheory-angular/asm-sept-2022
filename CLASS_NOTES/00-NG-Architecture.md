# Angular Architecture

Angular is for building application. It is not a good tool for building websites.

You have a an HTML page that is delivered to the user.

The HTML page has an element in it that will contain our running angular application.

That is created by downloading a bunch of javascript and that javascript "Creates" the application right in front of the users very eyes.
